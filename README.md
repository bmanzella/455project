# CSIT 455 Final Project

## Project Title
Inventory Tracking for Car Dealership

## Abstraction
Interested in logistic challenges of managing an inventory of cars at a dealership. We would like to make a system that organizes each vehicle by certain specifications such as make, model, year, color, type, etc. This can help buyers narrow down which vehicle they want and also help the dealership organize its inventory. We also want to incorporate a way to manage the employees of the dealership, as well as the customers and supplier of the vehicles that enter the dealership.

The DB will include tables like:
```
Vehicles: VehicleId, make, year, color, type, SupplierId
```
```
Employees: EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Address, DepartmentID
```
```
Customers: CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Address, PhoneNumber, Gender
```
```
Departments: DepartmentId, Name
```
```
Suppliers: SupplierID, SupplierName, Address
```
